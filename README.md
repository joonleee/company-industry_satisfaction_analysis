# Analyzing Satisfaction Factors by Company/Industry, a Tool

## **Introduction**

Job satisfaction is considered to be something important by employees and employers alike. 

We wanted to take a deeper look into job satisfaction factors with a couple questions in mind.

## The Problem

1. What factors affect job satisfaction in a workplace
2. How does job satisfaction differ across industries?

## The Goal

We proceeded to analyze job satisfaction by company/industry as a proof of concept for a tool to be used by individuals and companies alike.

Individuals can use this tool to analyze the satisfaction factors of companies they wish to work at, and company HRs can use this tool to analyze the satisfaction of their employees. 

As a company, HR could analyze the "current/ex-employee, satisfied" group to see what they are exceling at. A company should especially analyze the "current employee, unsatisfied" group to try and figure out what they are lacking in to improve their employee retention.
